We observed a full transit of TOI-6251.01 in g,r,i,zs bands with MuSCAT3 on the night of July 21, 2023 in local time (HST). We marginally detected a transit signal on target with a timing consistent with the prediction assuming the orbital period of 12.76d (half of the period in the TOI catalog).

The mid-transit time (Tc), measured with an achromatic transit model with a prior on T14 from the TESS data, is as follows:

Tc (BJD_TDB) = 2460148.0182 +0.0013 -0.0007
