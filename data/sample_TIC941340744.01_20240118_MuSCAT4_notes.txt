[Summary of the observation]

  Aperture radii: 16 pixels or 4.3" for all bands

 -----------

We observed a full transit of TOI-3353.01 in gp,rp,ip,zs bands with FTS-2m/MuSCAT4 in LCO/Siding Spring Observatory, New South Wales, Australia on the night of Jan 18, 2024 (UTC). 
We observed a full on 20240118 in gp, rp, ip, zs and detected a ~16-min late (~6 sigma) (Rp/R*)^2: 0.71, 0.92, 0.70, 1.2 ppt event using 4.3'' uncontaminated target aperture. We fit a chromatic transit model assuming a normal prior on transit duration. The radius ratios are consistent i.e. achromatic within 1-sigma. The feature around mid-transit is not clear if due to clouds or a flare. Excluding the data around mid-transit does not change the result significantly.

The mid-transit time (Tc), measured with a chromatic transit model, is as follows:

Tc (BJD_TDB) = Tc = 2460328.1256-0.0011+0.0012
Rp/Rs(g)^2 = 0.71 ppt
Rp/Rs(r)^2 = 0.92 ppt
Rp/Rs(i)^2 = 0.70 ppt
Rp/Rs(z)^2 = 1.20 ppt
